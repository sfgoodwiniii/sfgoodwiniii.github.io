This is the repository for my personal website, which is hosted at [staniel.dev](staniel.dev).

## Styling
This website follows a few conventions I have set for myself:

### Shared Assets

### Page Templates

### HTML

### CSS
CSS Template code should always contain the prefix `sdev-NAME__` before a class or ID name.
**Public** CSS Page code should always contain the prefix `page-NAME__` before a class or ID name.
**Private** CSS Page code should always contain the prefix `_` before a class or ID name.
