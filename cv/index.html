                <p>At part of my degree requirements, I worked in a physics lab for an entire year. I learned how to use many physics laboratory equipment like a mass spectrometer, x-ray diffractometer, and other standard physics equipment. I also learned how to use many python libraries like MatPlotLib and LMFIT for statistical analysis.</p>
                <p>During this time, I also developed a small package for handling data points, including units, values, and error bars. It interfaced very well with other objects in Python, and made my data analysis much easier. It was able to do unit conversions, allowing me to make sure I had things in appropriate units. I also integrated it with MatPlotLib and Numpy pretty well, but didn't complete the project before the end of the semester.</p>

                <p>As part of a research opportunity in Quantum Computing, I worked with Dr. Nicola Lanata on Variational Quantum Eigensolver simulation in Python using Qiskit. I adapted the Qiskit SPSA algorithm to utilize known Equation of State gradient descent. This experience helped me learn about computational physics research out in the private sector and communicating with other researchers.</p>

                <p>For my final project in PHYS-670, Teaching and Learning Physics, I wrote about how students approach the symbology that's found in Quantum Computing. In the end, it was a little incomplete, since I wanted to write more about different methods to teach students QC symbology, I was limited by the final deadline.</p>

                <p>During the summer of 2022, I worked as a computational physics researcher who was optimizing and expanding on the functionality of a previous graduate student. The simulation would find the minimal surface for an evaporating liquid droplet on different roughness and interfaces between them.</p>
                <p>I used C/C++ and the Fishnet Algorithm to find minimal surfaces using numerical integration of pressure.  The final results were then plotted by MATLAB for animations and surfaces. In the process, I documented my work in LaTeX using Overleaf so that my research could be continued after me.</p>

                <p>The topic of the 2020 National History Day was "Breaking Barriers" and so I chose to write about breaking into a new frontier of physics because of a small quirk of the speed of light being verified to be experimentally constant in a vacuum. As part of my physics class the next year, I revised the paper and made it into a website.</p>
